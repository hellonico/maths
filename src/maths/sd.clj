(ns maths.sd)

; In statistics and probability theory, the standard deviation (SD)
; (represented by the Greek letter sigma, Ïƒ) measures the amount of variation
; or dispersion from the average.[1]
; A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean
; (also called expected value); a high standard deviation indicates that the data points
; are spread out over a large range of values.
